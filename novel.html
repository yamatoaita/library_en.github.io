        <div class="right">Written by Ren hiratsuka</div><div><br></div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the misty forest, in a place no one has ever set foot in, a mansion stands quietly. The name of the mansion is "Seripent Mansion". As the name suggests, rumors of countless snakes entwining around the mansion have been passed down in the neighboring villages.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;One autumn evening, a young woman, Alice, knocked on the door of Seripent Mansion. She was visiting the mansion's owner, Duke Lucien Seripent, who was a distant relative of hers. Duke Lucien was a unique figure among his family, loving solitude and keeping his distance from the villagers. 
            Alice was fascinated by the family legend and visited this place with the sole desire to find out the truth.
             When the door opened, Lucien appeared from the darkness with cold, shining eyes. 
             He was thin but had a dignified presence, and a strange aura emanated from his entire body. 
             Behind him, an unusually large snake was quietly wriggling its body. "Welcome, Alice.
              We've been waiting for you." His low voice echoed.</div><div><br></div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the mansion was luxurious, yet somehow ominous, unlike the dilapidated impression outside. 
            The walls were lined with paintings and sculptures with snake motifs, and a huge fresco of a giant snake spread across the ceiling.
             "What does all this mean? "When Alice asked, Lucian smiled.
              His smile was somewhat sad and at the same time eerie.
               "The Serpent family has a deep connection with snakes.
                And that connection is not just symbolic."
            Before she could understand what, he meant, Alice began to witness strange phenomena in the mansion.
            </div><div><br></div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, low whispers echoed around her bedroom, and the figure of a strange woman was sometimes reflected in the mirror.
             And most frightening of all was the figure of a giant snake that she would occasionally see in the hallways of the mansion. 
             The snake stared at her with its cold golden eyes, as if it was watching her.</div><div><br></div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, Alice stood in front of a locked room deep inside the mansion. Her curiosity piqued her, and she had a strong urge to go inside.
             She opened the door and found an old altar, and in its center was a giant snake statue. 
             The statue's eyes were adorned with jewels, and they glowed as if they were alive. 
             "Don't touch it. "Suddenly, Lucian's voice rang out from behind her.
              But Alice's hand was already touching the statue.
               At that moment, a cold sensation ran through her body, and her vision went dark.</div><div><br></div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;When she woke up, Alice noticed something strange happening to her body.
             A pattern like a snake's scales appeared on her arm, and her eyes were emitting a cold light just like Lucian's. 
             "This is the fate of the Serpent family." Lucian spoke quietly.</div> 
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice began to understand the meaning of his words. 
            The Serpent family was a cursed existence living between humans and snakes, and they were forced to live alone to protect their bloodline. 
            And so, she too had no choice but to accept her fate.
            But still, the will to resist began to grow within Alice.
             She began to search for a way to change her fate. 
             However, every time she left the mansion, a shadow in the shape of a snake continued to pursue her. 
             Will Alice be able to break free of this cursed fate? 
            Or will she be trapped under the curse of the Serpent forever?
            </div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mist of the forest deepens, the mansion continues to stand silently. 
            And all around it, the whispering of the snakes echoes ceaselessly.</div>
